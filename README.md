## Agile Development Process

This project was developed using the **Agile methodology** with a **Kanban board** hosted on GitHub Projects.

###  Planning and Workflow

- The development process was broken into **user stories**, representing real user needs and functionality goals.
- Each user story was converted into a GitHub **issue** with acceptance criteria and added to the project board.
- The board was divided into columns:
  - **Backlog** ‚Äì ideas/features not yet started
  - **To Do** ‚Äì stories selected for the current sprint
  - **In Progress** ‚Äì tasks currently being worked on
  - **Review / Testing** ‚Äì features completed and ready for testing
  - **Done** ‚Äì completed and deployed features

###  User Stories

User stories were written from the perspective of different users, including:
- Unauthenticated users (browsing, viewing artwork)
- Authenticated users (making purchases, viewing order history)
- The site owner (managing inventory, monitoring sales)

Each story followed the standard format:

> As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].

 All user stories were manually tested and tracked via GitHub issues and commits.

###  Agile Features Summary

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/mirjanacale//)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://mirjanacale.github.io//)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

There are no major differences between the local (Gitpod) version and the deployed (GitHub Pages) version that I'm aware of.
